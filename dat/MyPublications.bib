The specific molecular mechanisms that drive aging are poorly understood, especially the contribution of the microbiota in these processes. Here, we combined multi-omics with metabolic modeling in mice to comprehensively characterize host-microbiome interactions and how they are affected by aging. Our findings reveal a complex dependency of host metabolism on microbial functions, including previously known as well as novel interactions. We observed a pronounced reduction in metabolic activity within the aging microbiome, which we attribute to reduced beneficial interactions in the microbial community and a reduction in its metabolic output. These microbial changes coincided with a corresponding downregulation of key host pathways predicted by our model to be dependent on the microbiome that are crucial for maintaining intestinal barrier function, cellular replication, and homeostasis. Our results elucidate microbiome-host interactions that potentially influence host aging processes, focusing on microbial nucleotide metabolism as a pivotal factor in aging dynamics. These pathways could serve as future targets for the development of microbiome-based therapies against aging.},

	abstract = {Summary
          
            Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with perturbed metabolism of the essential amino acid tryptophan (Trp). Whether increased degradation of Trp directly fuels mucosal inflammation or acts as a compensatory attempt to restore cellular energy levels via
            de-novo
            nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD
            +
            ) synthesis is not understood. Employing a systems medicine approach on longitudinal IBD therapy intervention cohorts and targeted screening in preclinical IBD models, we discover that steady increases in Trp levels upon therapy success coincide with a rewiring of metabolic processes within the kynurenine pathway (KP). In detail, we identify that Trp catabolism in IBD is metabolically constrained at the level of quinolinate phosphorybosyltransferase (QPRT), leading to accumulation of quinolinic acid (Quin) and a decrease of NAD
            +
            . We further demonstrate that Trp degradation along the KP occurs locally in the inflamed intestinal mucosa and critically depends on janus kinase / signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT) signalling. Subsequently, knockdown of
            QPRT in-vitro
            induces NAD
            +
            depletion and a pro-inflammatory state, which can largely be rescued by bypassing QPRT via other NAD
            +
            precursors. We hence propose a model of impaired
            de-novo
            NAD

            synthesis from Trp in IBD. These findings point towards the replenishment of NAD

	abstract = {Abstract
          
            Background
            Inflammation is characterized by a metabolic switch promoting glycolysis and lactate production. Hexokinases (HK) catalyze the first reaction of glycolysis and inhibition of epithelial HK2 protected from colitis in mice. HK2 expression has been described as elevated in patients with intestinal inflammation, however there is conflicting data from few cohorts especially with severely inflamed individuals, thus systematic studies linking disease activity with HK2 levels are needed.
          
          
            Methods
            We examined the relationship between HK2 expression and inflammation severity using bulk transcriptome data derived from the mucosa of thoroughly phenotyped patients suffering from intestinal inflammation of two independent cohorts. Analyzing publicly available single cell RNA sequencing data and performing immunofluorescence on colonic biopsies of unrelated patients with intestinal inflammation confirmed the RNA-based findings on cellular and protein level.
          
          
            Results
            HK2 expression gradually increased from mild to intermediate inflammation, yet strongly declined at high inflammation scores. Expression of epithelial marker genes also declined at high inflammation scores, whereas that of candidate immune marker genes increased, indicating a cellular remodeling of the mucosa during inflammation with an infiltration of HK2-negative immune cells and a loss of the apical epithelium – the main site of HK2 expression. Normalizing for the enterocyte loss clearly identified epithelial HK2 expression as gradually increasing with disease activity and remaining elevated at high inflammation scores. HK2 protein expression was mostly restricted to brush border enterocytes and these cells along with HK2 levels vanished with increasing disease severity.
          
          
            Conclusions
            Our findings clearly define dysregulated epithelial HK2 expression as an indicator of disease activity in intestinal inflammation and suggest targeted HK2-inhibition as a potential therapeutic avenue.},

          Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are chronic disorders involving dysregulated immune responses. Despite the role of disrupted host-microbial interaction in the pathophysiology of IBD, the underlying metabolic principles are not fully understood. We densely profiled microbiome, transcriptome and metabolome signatures from longitudinal IBD cohorts before and after advanced drug therapy initiation and reconstructed metabolic models of the gut microbiome and the host intestine to study host-microbiome metabolic cross-talk in the context of inflammation. We identified concomitant changes in metabolic activity across data layers involving NAD, amino acid, one-carbon and phospholipid metabolism. In particular on the host level, elevated tryptophan catabolism depleted circulating tryptophan, thereby impairing NAD biosynthesis. Reduced host transamination reactions disrupted nitrogen homeostasis and polyamine/glutathione metabolism. The suppressed one-carbon cycle in patient tissues altered phospholipid profiles due to limited choline availability. Simultaneously, microbiome metabolic shifts in NAD, amino acid and polyamine metabolism exacerbated these host metabolic imbalances. Leveraging host and microbe metabolic models, we predicted dietary interventions remodeling the microbiome to restore metabolic homeostasis, suggesting novel therapeutic strategies for IBD.},

            Host-microbial metabolic interactions have been recognised as an essential factor in host health and disease. Genome-scale metabolic modelling approaches have made important contributions to our understanding of the interactions in such communities. One particular such modelling approach is BacArena in which metabolic models grow, reproduce, and interact as independent agents in a spatiotemporal metabolic environment. Here, we present a modelling application of BacArena, a virtual colonic environment, which reveals spatiotemporal metabolic interactions in a computational colonic environment. This environment resembles the crypt space together with the mucus layers, the lumen and fluid dynamics. Our proof-of-principle experiments include mono-colonisation simulations of context-specific colonic cells and simulations of context-specific colonic cells with the SIHUMIx minimal model microbiome. Our simulations propose host-microbial and microbial-microbial interactions that can be verified based on the literature. Most importantly, the Virtual Colon offers visualisation of interactions through time and space, adding another dimension to the genome-scale metabolic modelling approaches. Lastly, like BacArena, it is freely available and can be easily adapted to model other spatially structured environments (

              offers unique features to encode these complex interactions of developmental processes with biotic and abiotic factors, and we used it here to investigate the impact of bacterial colonizers and temperature on the pattern formation process. In

              polyps are significantly more sensitive to ALP compared to control polyps. In addition to microbes, β-catenin–dependent pattern formation is also affected by temperature.

            The microbiota of multicellular organisms undergoes considerable changes during development but the general mechanisms that control community assembly and succession are poorly understood. Here, we use bacterial recolonization experiments in
            Nematostella vectensis
            as a model to understand general mechanisms determining bacterial establishment and succession. We compared the dynamic establishment of the microbiome on the germfree host and on inert silica. Following the dynamic reconstruction of microbial communities on both substrates, we show that the initial colonization events are strongly influenced by the host but not by the tube, while the subsequent bacteria-bacteria interactions are the main cause of bacterial succession. Interestingly, the recolonization pattern on adult hosts resembles the ontogenetic colonization succession. This process occurs independently of the bacterial composition of the inoculum and can be followed at the level of individual bacteria, suggesting that priority effects are neglectable for early colonization events in
            Nematostella
            . To identify potential metabolic traits associated with initial colonization success and potential metabolic interactions among bacteria associated with bacterial succession, we reconstructed the metabolic networks of bacterial colonizers based on their genomes. These analyses revealed that bacterial metabolic capabilities reflect the recolonization pattern, and the degradation of chitin might be a selection factor during early colonization of the animal. Concurrently, transcriptomic analyses revealed that
            Nematostella
            possesses two chitin synthase genes, one of which is upregulated during early recolonization. Our results show that early colonization events are strongly controlled by the host while subsequent colonization depends on metabolic bacteria-bacteria interactions largely independent of host development.},

They control the metamorphosis and sexual maturation in virtually all animals and by that the two main environmental-dependent developmental decision points. Sexual maturation and metamorphosis are controlled by steroid receptors and thyroid receptors, respectively in vertebrates, while both processes are orchestrated by the ecdysone receptor (EcR) in insects. The regulation of these processes depends on environmental factors like nutrition, temperature, or photoperiods and by that NRs form evolutionary conserved mediators of phenotypic plasticity. While the mechanism of action for metamorphosis and sexual maturation are well studied in model organisms, the evolution of these systems is not entirely understood and requires further investigation. We here review the current knowledge of NR involvement in metamorphosis and sexual maturation across the animal tree of life with special attention to environmental integration and evolution of the signaling mechanism. Furthermore, we compare commonalities and differences of the different signaling systems. Finally, we identify key gaps in our knowledge of NR evolution, which, if sufficiently investigated, would lead to an importantly improved understanding of the evolution of complex signaling systems, the evolution of life history decision points, and, ultimately, speciation events in the metazoan kingdom.},

	abstract = {Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic and progressive neurodegenerative disease with the major symptoms comprising loss of movement coordination (motor dysfunction) and non-motor dysfunction, including gastrointestinal symptoms. Alterations in the gut microbiota composition have been reported in PD patients vs. controls. However, it is still unclear how these compositional changes contribute to disease etiology and progression. Furthermore, most of the available studies have focused on European, Asian, and North American cohorts, but the microbiomes of PD patients in Latin America have not been characterized. To address this problem, we obtained fecal samples from Colombian participants (n = 25 controls, n = 25 PD idiopathic cases) to characterize the taxonomical community changes during disease via 16S rRNA gene sequencing. An analysis of differential composition, diversity, and personalized computational modeling was carried out, given the fecal bacterial composition and diet of each participant. We found three metabolites that differed in dietary habits between PD patients and controls: carbohydrates, trans fatty acids, and potassium. We identified six genera that changed significantly in their relative abundance between PD patients and controls, belonging to the families Lachnospiraceae, Lactobacillaceae, Verrucomicrobioaceae, Peptostreptococcaceae, and Streptococcaceae. Furthermore, personalized metabolic modeling of the gut microbiome revealed changes in the predicted production of seven metabolites (Indole, tryptophan, fructose, phenylacetic acid, myristic acid, 3-Methyl-2-oxovaleric acid, and N-Acetylneuraminic acid). These metabolites are associated with the metabolism of aromatic amino acids and their consumption in the diet. Therefore, this research suggests that each individual's diet and intestinal composition could affect host metabolism. Furthermore, these findings open the door to the study of microbiome-host interactions and allow us to contribute to personalized medicine.},

	abstract = {The microbiome is increasingly receiving attention as an important modulator of host health and disease. However, while numerous mechanisms through which the microbiome influences its host have been identified, there is still a lack of approaches that allow to specifically modulate the abundance of individual microbes or microbial functions of interest. Moreover, current approaches for microbiome manipulation such as fecal transfers often entail a non-specific transfer of entire microbial communities with potentially unwanted side effects. To overcome this limitation, we here propose the concept of precision prebiotics that specifically modulate the abundance of a microbiome member species of interest. In a first step, we show that defining precision prebiotics by compounds that are only taken up by the target species but no other species in a community is usually not possible due to overlapping metabolic niches. Subsequently, we present a metabolic modeling network framework that allows us to define precision prebiotics for a two-member C. elegans microbiome model community comprising the immune-protective Pseudomonas lurida MYb11 and the persistent colonizer Ochrobactrum vermis MYb71. Thus, we predicted compounds that specifically boost the abundance of the host-beneficial MYb11, four of which were experimentally validated in vitro (L-serine, L-threonine, D-mannitol, and γ-aminobutyric acid). L-serine was further assessed in vivo, leading to an increase in MYb11 abundance also in the worm host. Overall, our findings demonstrate that constraint-based metabolic modeling is an effective tool for the design of precision prebiotics as an important cornerstone for future microbiome-targeted therapies.},
