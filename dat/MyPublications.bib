	abstract = {The microbiome is increasingly receiving attention as an important modulator of host health and disease. However, while numerous mechanisms through which the microbiome influences its host have been identified, there is still a lack of approaches that allow to specifically modulate the abundance of individual microbes or microbial functions of interest. Moreover, current approaches for microbiome manipulation such as fecal transfers often entail a non-specific transfer of entire microbial communities with potentially unwanted side effects. To overcome this limitation, we here propose the concept of precision prebiotics that specifically modulate the abundance of a microbiome member species of interest. In a first step, we show that defining precision prebiotics by compounds that are only taken up by the target species but no other species in a community is usually not possible due to overlapping metabolic niches. Subsequently, we present a metabolic modeling network framework that allows us to define precision prebiotics for a two-member C. elegans microbiome model community comprising the immune-protective Pseudomonas lurida MYb11 and the persistent colonizer Ochrobactrum vermis MYb71. Thus, we predicted compounds that specifically boost the abundance of the host-beneficial MYb11, four of which were experimentally validated in vitro (L-serine, L-threonine, D-mannitol, and γ-aminobutyric acid). L-serine was further assessed in vivo, leading to an increase in MYb11 abundance also in the worm host. Overall, our findings demonstrate that constraint-based metabolic modeling is an effective tool for the design of precision prebiotics as an important cornerstone for future microbiome-targeted therapies.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          
            The microbiota of multicellular organisms undergoes considerable changes during development but the general mechanisms that control community assembly and succession are poorly understood. Here, we use bacterial recolonization experiments in
            Nematostella vectensis
            as a model to understand general mechanisms determining bacterial establishment and succession. We compared the dynamic establishment of the microbiome on the germfree host and on inert silica. Following the dynamic reconstruction of microbial communities on both substrates, we show that the initial colonization events are strongly influenced by the host but not by the tube, while the subsequent bacteria-bacteria interactions are the main cause of bacterial succession. Interestingly, the recolonization pattern on adult hosts resembles the ontogenetic colonization succession. This process occurs independently of the bacterial composition of the inoculum and can be followed at the level of individual bacteria, suggesting that priority effects are neglectable for early colonization events in
            Nematostella
            . To identify potential metabolic traits associated with initial colonization success and potential metabolic interactions among bacteria associated with bacterial succession, we reconstructed the metabolic networks of bacterial colonizers based on their genomes. These analyses revealed that bacterial metabolic capabilities reflect the recolonization pattern, and the degradation of chitin might be a selection factor during early colonization of the animal. Concurrently, transcriptomic analyses revealed that
            Nematostella
            possesses two chitin synthase genes, one of which is upregulated during early recolonization. Our results show that early colonization events are strongly controlled by the host while subsequent colonization depends on metabolic bacteria-bacteria interactions largely independent of host development.},

Factors driving variation in the diversity of host-associated microbes are complex and still poorly understood. Here, we describe the bacterial composition of field-collected
              Hydra
              , a freshwater cnidarian that forms stable associations with microbial species in the laboratory and displays complex interactions with components of the microbiota. We sampled
              Hydra
              polyps from 21 Central European water bodies and identified bacterial taxa through 16S rRNA sequencing. We asked whether diversity and taxonomic composition of host-associated bacteria depends on sampling location, habitat type, host species or host reproductive mode (sexual vs. asexual). Bacterial diversity was most strongly explained by sampling location, suggesting that the source environment plays an important role in the assembly of bacterial communities associated with
              Hydra
              polyps. We also found significant differences between host species in their bacterial composition that partly mirrored variations observed in lab strains. Furthermore, we detected a minor effect of host reproductive mode on bacterial diversity. Overall, our results suggest that extrinsic (habitat identity) factors predict the diversity of host-associated bacterial communities more strongly than intrinsic (species identity) factors, however, only a combination of both factors determines microbiota composition in

	abstract = {Nuclear receptors (NRs) fulfill key roles in the coordination of postembryonal developmental transitions in animal species. They control the metamorphosis and sexual maturation in virtually all animals and by that the two main environmental-dependent developmental decision points. Sexual maturation and metamorphosis are controlled by steroid receptors and thyroid receptors, respectively in vertebrates, while both processes are orchestrated by the ecdysone receptor (EcR) in insects. The regulation of these processes depends on environmental factors like nutrition, temperature, or photoperiods and by that NRs form evolutionary conserved mediators of phenotypic plasticity. While the mechanism of action for metamorphosis and sexual maturation are well studied in model organisms, the evolution of these systems is not entirely understood and requires further investigation. We here review the current knowledge of NR involvement in metamorphosis and sexual maturation across the animal tree of life with special attention to environmental integration and evolution of the signaling mechanism. Furthermore, we compare commonalities and differences of the different signaling systems. Finally, we identify key gaps in our knowledge of NR evolution, which, if sufficiently investigated, would lead to an importantly improved understanding of the evolution of complex signaling systems, the evolution of life history decision points, and, ultimately, speciation events in the metazoan kingdom.},

              Hydra
              offers unique features to encode these complex interactions of developmental processes with biotic and abiotic factors, and we used it here to investigate the impact of bacterial colonizers and temperature on the pattern formation process. In
              Hydra
              , formation of the head organizer involves the canonical Wnt pathway. Treatment with alsterpaullone (ALP) results in acquiring characteristics of the head organizer in the body column. Intriguingly, germfree
              Hydra
              polyps are significantly more sensitive to ALP compared to control polyps. In addition to microbes, β-catenin–dependent pattern formation is also affected by temperature. Gene expression analyses led to the identification of two small secreted peptides, named Eco1 and Eco2, being up-regulated in the response to both
